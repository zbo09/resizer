# This small library was written to resize all png and jpeg
# images inside a directory. Just require 'resizer.rb' and
# provide the path as an argument when used within an application.
#
# ==== Example if using inside a ruby application
#
#   resizer = Resize::ImageMagick.new
#   resizer.find_and_resize!(<path-to-image-directory>)
#
#
# ==== Example for using via command line
#
#   ruby resizer.rb --path <path-to-image-directory>

# The handlers used for modification of image
# files. We can add extra, or custom libraries.
#
# Ideally these handlers would be written independent of the Resize
# module and using include, included into the Resize module
# adding additional handlers to existing Resize module.
#
# We could create a directory containing the new handlers and using
# Ruby's meta-programming features iterate over each file inside the
# directory and include them automatically
#
# We would need to implement an interface for each of the handlers
# so there is always only one method to be called and that method
# must be implemented in any new handlers added to the directory.

  # We would like to be able to grow with different types of `handlers`

USAGE = <<ENDUSAGE
Usage:

  To use resizer in a ruby application simply include it into your project:

      require 'resizer.rb'

      sizer = Resize::<Tool>.new
      sizer.find_and_resize!(<path to images>)

  Or to use it via command line:

      ruby resize.rb [-p <path to images>] --path <path to images>
ENDUSAGE

HELP = <<ENDHELP

  Help information:

      -h, --help       Show help.
      -p, --path       Specify the path to the directory containing the images
